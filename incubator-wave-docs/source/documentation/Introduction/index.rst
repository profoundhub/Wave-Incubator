What are we doing?
------------------

        This document is being provided to help everyday amateur to advanced programmers contribute to the Apache Wave
        documentation. If you would like to learn more about apache wave itself please visit
        https://incubator.apache.org/wave/ .

        This document provides information in setting up and contributing to the documentation process using the Sphinx
        project and ReStructured Text. This is also provided as an example for the other documents in the Git repository
        .

Who is doing this?
------------------

        The Apache Wave project is being developed in the Apache Foundations Incubator and comprises of volunteers.


Why are we doing this?
----------------------

        The Apache Wave project has been in the incubator since 2010 and has had a lacking of documentation or
        development progress due to its large complexity. By making the documentation process easier the project hopes
        to remove the barriers for new developers to start contributing.
